## Introduction 

The main goal is create some projects responsible to analyze and generate somes graphics to compare some data. 

## Projects

## *Growth of the brasilian population*

### Case study - Growth of the brasilian population

In this case, we are create a graphic to growth of the brasilian population informations.

> Data SUS
> Source: http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=02

**Final Result**
We are generate a graphic to print growth brasilian population informations.

## *DNA Genome Comparator*

### Case study - Bio Cience - Comparing Genomes

<img src="data-science/files/images/dna_image.svg"/>

In this case study, we do a comparision between both of dna sequences: **(1) human vs (2) bacteria** 

> DNA is a molecule presents in all of living beings, it's responsible for store the 
hereditary characteristics. It's composed to nucleotides sequences, can be 4 kinds: adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.

"Computationally" saying, we can represent them through 4 words: A, T, C or G.

In this case, we can to evaluate if structs with same functions(we are using ribosomal RNA sequences) of different organisms, have differences. For this, we are to evaluate the number of pairs of nucleotides. 

**Used data:**

> Human 18S rRNA gene, complete
> Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M10098.1?report=fasta

> Escherichia coli strain U 5/41 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence
> Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NR_024570.1?report=fasta

**Final Result**
We are generate 2 graphics to compare both DNAs.
